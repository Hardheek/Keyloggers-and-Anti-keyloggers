# Keyloggers-and-Anti-keyloggers
keylogger will be created that will allow us to record all the keystrokes. Keylogger (keyboard keylogging and mouse keylogging) is a form of surveillance program that has the ability to record every keystroke made on that device once installed in a device, and the recordings are stored in a spreadsheet. In other words, it will allow us to obtain information from a keyboard about anything that is typed. This will allow us to track the use of the Internet by an individual and all the other programs on his or her personal computer. Keyloggers could also be used, on the other hand, to intercept data in the form of malware or something close to it. An Anti-keylogger will also be built to counter this problem, which should allow us to detect if a keylogger is already monitoring the device. The Anti-keylogger will enable us to be careful and to keep our system's data secure.
